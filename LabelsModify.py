"""This function is used in the manual modification of the labels.

It starts from a matrix-image with labeled connected objects and cuts or merges
labels depending on the array_region and end_pts. Array_region is the vector
with the values of the pixels above the segment in the matrix-image. end_pts are
the coordinate of the extremal point of the segment. The out put is the updated
version of the labels_img.
